This discrepancy is perplexing and deserves further investigation, especially considering that potential missing physics in the models would likely conspire to make F-stars older, not younger."

I have attempted to emphasize a distinction between models and real stars by emphasizing that ages are inferred from models and are not a definite property of F-type stars.

> - Figure 4: It is much more common to discuss the mass of the convective envelope than of the radiative core.

This is true. I adopted the radiative core mass for consistency with Gregory et al. (2012), who used radiative core mass to explain variations in the geometry and complexity of large-scale magnetic fields among young stars. However, as noted by the reviewer, it is not an optimal selection, as convection zone structure is more pertinent for theoretical discussions of stellar structure and 3D magnetic dynamo simulations.

I've recast the discussion and Figure 4 in terms of convective envelope mass and refer to radiative core mass only for comparison with Gregory et al. (2012).
