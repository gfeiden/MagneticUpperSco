Editors Forveille & Bertout,

I have now uploaded the final version of my manuscript. The final version includes revisions following suggestions by the copy editor and several small corrections that I caught during a final proof reading, which are purely grammatical or intended to add clarification. In only one instance did I not execute a change suggested by the copy editor. This is detailed below along with a summary of each change made to the document. Page numbers refer to the page in the "referee" version.

Thank you for considering my article for publication and thank you for the time and effort you devote to A&A. 

Best regards,

Gregory Feiden

Declined changes

- Pg 21: (par 0, sen 0) The editor suggested changing "appear roughly" to "are roughly." However, I prefer "appear roughly" since "are" implies the stars are actually 4 - 5 Myr older, whereas models only suggest that they are 4 - 5 Myr older. I respectfully request to leave the phrasing as it is.
