Referee report

I have reviewed the latest draft of the paper and find it is essentially ready to be accepted. I would encourage the author to consider the following minor comments:

- Section 5: I find the following two sentences difficult to understand. There is some confusion between real stars and models that needs to be clarified.

"There are, however, still age discrepancies that must be addressed. As noted above, the median age for F-type stars appears to be a few million years older than stars of other spectral types. This discrepancy is perplexing and deserves further investigation, especially considering that potential missing physics in the models would likely conspire to make F-stars older, not younger."

- Figure 4: It is much more common to discuss the mass of the convective envelope than of the radiative core.
