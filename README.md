## Abstract

When determining absolute ages of identifiably young stellar populations, results 
strongly depend on which stars are studied. Cooler (K, M) stars typically yield 
ages that are systematically younger than warmer (A, F, G) stars by a factor of 
two. I explore the possibility that these age discrepancies are the result of magnetic 
inhibition of convection in cool young stars by using magnetic stellar evolution 
isochrones to determine the age of the Upper Scorpius subgroup of the Scorpius-Centaurus 
OB Association. A median age of 10 Myr consistent across spectral types A through 
M is found, except for a subset of F-type stars that appear significantly older. 
Agreement is shown for ages derived from the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and from 
the empirical mass-radius relationship defined by eclipsing multiple-star systems. 
Surface magnetic field strengths required to produce agreement are of order 2.5 kG 
and are predicted from _a priori_ estimates of equipartition values. A 
region in the HR diagram is identified that plausibly connects stars whose structures 
are weakly influenced by the presence of magnetic fields with those whose structures 
are strongly influenced by magnetic fields. The models suggest this region is 
characterized by stars with rapidly thinning outer convective envelopes where the 
radiative core mass is greater than 75% of the total stellar mass. Furthermore, 
depletion of lithium predicted from magnetic models appears in better agreement 
with observed lithium equivalent widths than predictions from non-magnetic models. 
These results suggest that magnetic inhibition of convection plays an important 
role in the early evolution of low-mass stars and that it may be responsible for 
noted age discrepancies in young stellar populations.
